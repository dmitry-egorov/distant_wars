- optimize presentation, when there was no simulation tick
- don't start blinking when outside the screen?
- separate editor mechanics
- render space grid lines
- fire in advance (need previous position, goes along with steady update)
- radar (find all within radar range, mark as discovered if also within vision range)
- explosion after bullet hit
- ballistics
- buildings
  - factory
  - metal gatherer
  - energy gatherer
- show hp when zomming in
- move command visual feedback

- store unit's interpolated positions?
- unity math, jobs, arrays?
- how to preserve discovered texture??
- space grid per team

+ steady update
+ filter discovery quads by fully visible grid cells
+ rework grid iteration
+ filter vision quads by fully visible grid cells
+ box selection -> use grid
+ find visibility for all teams
+ filter unit sprites
+ optimize search with space grid
+ firing and destruction
  + attacking
  + bullet firing
  + hp
  + ray intersect collision
  + fire while moving
  + intersect terrain
  + destruction
  + blinking when attacked
+ scale independent bullet sprite
+ space grid
+ faction colors
+ hide enemy units
+ screen space visibility
+ terrain movement speed modifier
