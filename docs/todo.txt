- filter vision quads by fully visible grid cells
- filter unit sprites
- find visibility for all teams
- space grid per team
- radar (find all within radar range, mark as discovered if also within vision range)
- steady update
- fire in advance (need previous position, goes along with steady update)
- buildings
  - factory
  - metal gatherer
  - energy gatherer
- show hp when zomming in
- move command feedback

- unity math, jobs, arrays?
- how to preserve discovered texture??


+ optimize search with space grid
+ firing and destruction
  + attacking
  + bullet firing
  + hp
  + ray intersect collision
  + fire while moving
  + intersect terrain
  + destruction
  + blinking when attacked
+ scale independent bullet sprite
+ space grid
+ faction colors
+ hide enemy units
+ screen space visibility
+ terrain movement speed modifier


* find min/max of the vision
* mark all
